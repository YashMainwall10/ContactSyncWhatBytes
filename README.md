Used Firebase Firestore for storing Contact Data of Users 
here is the contacts details , i used a template data of just 25 contacts and assuming there are no NULL values in the DataBase for each Entry 
took help from Google Documentation for ContactsContract API and real time permission for Contact Permission - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract
